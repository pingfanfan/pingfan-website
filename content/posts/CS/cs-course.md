Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming
This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.

Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.


It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.

However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.

Client-side development with React

We’ve already had courses that will get us familiar with the client-side of front-end development. The first course was with HTML and CSS, then the second was JavaScript and the third is going to be with React. This course will be the culmination of our front-end development courses.

React is a JS library (like Vue and Angular, Angular is a framework), that helps you with the front-end development. It handles stuff like routing, creating reusable components (which is the core of React), fetching data from the backend, etc.

It is very useful and very popular since it is lightweight and highly customizable. We recommend that every engineer should know at least one front-end library.


 

 

Distributed Computing & Systems
In this course, you are going to get familiar with Distributed Computing and Systems. Wikipedia: “Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.

Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.” For this course, we recommend a video playlist from MIT, that is 21 videos, and the videos are quite long, and useful.

Semester 6
Non-relational Databases
This course is another version of the Databases course from the previous semester. The Databases course was based on relational databases, since those are easier to understand, and quite similar to the OOP concept and are the most used and most popular solutions for most of the products on the market.

But not most of those solutions, have the same complexity or data formats. To satisfy those needs, we have different types of non-relational databases, like: Document-based (Mongo, Firebase), Text Search Engines (Elasticsearch), Multimodal (Fauna), etc.

In this course, you are going to get familiar with Document-based databases, or more precisely with Mongo.

Robotics
MIT: “Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions that involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.

This course discusses nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on machine learning methods. Topics include nonlinear dynamics of passive robots (walkers, swimmers, flyers), motion planning, partial feedback linearization, energy-shaping control, analytical optimal control, reinforcement learning/approximate optimal control, and the influence of mechanical design on control.

Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.” For this course, we recommend you the MIT playlist that has 23 videos.
